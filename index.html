  <h1>Welcome to My Pre-Med Science Study Notes</h1>
  <p>I avoided science courses as much as possible.</p>
  <p>I did pretty well in the courses but never really thought it interesting to study.</p>
  <p>I was more into music, arts, humanities, math at the time in my 1st quarter of life. Still am.</p>
  <p>But yoga sparked my interest in biology, anatomy and physiology and the huma psyche.</p>
  <p>Visiting art museums, seeing grand sculptures in England, France, Italy, Spain, South & SE Asia, made it evident that scientific observations and understanding of the human body was vital to creating beautiful pieces of art</p>
  <p>When I took art courses, I was in awe of the professor's extensive knowledge on human anatomy.</p>
  <p>I traveled to 30+ countries and even more cities and further reaffirmed what I already knew--</p>
  <p>it doesn't matter where you landed on this planet -- people have got mental and health problems. But not everyone has the resources to cope and heal</p>
  <p>I believe that by educating people on how their body works</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Why is that fit and strong guy struggling with balancing poses in yoga? And has limited shoulder movement range?</li>
    <li>How can she do that yoga headstand? What muscles is she using?</li>
    <li>Why did my mother's kidneys start failing down to 10-20% function?</li>
    <li>Why did my mother's kidneys recover back to 90%?</li>
    <li>Why does my friend want to unalive herself? Why is my other friend so happy all the time?</li>
    <li>Why didn't my muffins rise and become soft and fluffy and moist? ugh!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Point is...  behind my questions</p>
