 <p>I avoided science courses as much as possible.</p>
  I did pretty well in the courses but never really thought it interesting to study.<br />
  I was more into music, arts, humanities, math at the time in my 1st quarter of life. Still am.<br />

  BUT then...<br />
    yoga sparked my interest in biology, anatomy and physiology and the human psyche.<br />
  PLUS being in the presence of such incredible and magnificent art and sculptures (<i>David</i> statue is one of my faves)...<br />
      made it evident that scientific observations and understanding of the human body was vital to creating beautiful pieces of art<br />
 <p>When I took art courses, I was in awe of the professor's extensive knowledge on human anatomy.</p>

      My travels also contributed to my newfound interest in medicine. I traveled to 30+ countries and even more cities and further reaffirmed what I already knew:<br />
  it doesn't matter where you landed on this planet -- people have got mental and health problems. But not everyone has the resources to cope and heal.<br />
  <p>I believe that by educating people on how their body and brain works, they will be empowered to take control of their health and even take preventative measures. </p>

  <p>My goal is to be a physician and serve both my local community AND communities around the world that have limited resources and access to health professionals and facilities.</p>
    <p>For now I will start with sharing my notes :P </p>
