 <p>I avoided science courses as much as possible.</p>
  <p>I did pretty well in the courses but never really thought it interesting to study.</p>
  <p>I was more into music, arts, humanities, math at the time in my 1st quarter of life. Still am.</p>
  <p>But yoga sparked my interest in biology, anatomy and physiology and the huma psyche.</p>
  <p>Visiting art museums, seeing grand sculptures in England, France, Italy, Spain, South & SE Asia, made it evident that scientific observations and understanding of the human body was vital to creating beautiful pieces of art</p>
  <p>When I took art courses, I was in awe of the professor's extensive knowledge on human anatomy.</p>
  <p>I traveled to 30+ countries and even more cities and further reaffirmed what I already knew--</p>
  <p>it doesn't matter where you landed on this planet -- people have got mental and health problems. But not everyone has the resources to cope and heal</p>
  <p>I believe that by educating people on how their body and brain works, they will be empowered to take control of their health and even take preventative measures. </p>

  <p>My goal is to be a physician and serve both my local community AND communities around the world that have limited resources and access to health professionals and facilities.</p>
