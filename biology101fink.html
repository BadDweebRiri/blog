<h2>Part 1-2</h2>
Biology
- Bio = life
- Logy = scientific study from greek root logos 
<p>
Facts are anything you can measure and you keep getting same measurable value
<p>
Explanation of how the world works

Assumptions of Science
1. The universe behaves mechanically, governed by a natural order. Not just random! “God does not play dice with the universe. “  — Albert Einstein. But science cannot prove this. ASSUMPTION!
2. There is a cause-and-effect relationship behind every event. i.e. why did someone get cancer? We believe that something caused it. We may not know the exact cause, but the whole approach of science is to find the causes of cancer. So that we can PREVENT cancer. 
3. This natural order of the universe is knowable to us. Epistemology: how do we know what we think we know? We are limited in what we can see even with a telescope and a microscope, limited with what we can hear, touch, our minds are limited in what they can comprehend. Yet in spite of limitations, science assumes if we continue this study over and over and long enough, we will understand it. We have been able to discover SO MUCH in spite of our limitations. Cars, AI, etc. 

The Scientific Method
* Formally stated by Sir Francis Bacon, a 17th century philosopher
* 4 step process:
    * (1) Ask a question -wtf why isn’t my car starting?
    * (2) Offer a hypothesis -did my battery die? - accept or reject
    * (3) Collect Data from observation or experiment
    * (4) Theory 
    * (5) Scientific Law

Marathon runners are scrawny and have high endurance their internal hearts become 2-3x larger than typical hearts. They can pump massive volumes of blood for prolonged periods of time.

Study study and the more educated guesses you can make!

Facts are anything you can measure and you keep getting same measurable value

Explanation of how the world works

- Hypothesis results must be duplicated.
- Theories have tremendous amount of evidence and generally accepted.
    - I.e cell theory
- Scientific Law is UNIVERSALLY accepts it. 
    - i.e. the Scientific Law of Gravity - Every object creates a gravitational pull.
        - The larger the object the greater the gravitational pull. Earth vs Moon. On the moon you can jump 12 ft. Jupiter - quarter/half an inch jumps
    - Descriptive Sciences - measurements, anatomy
    - Experimental Sciences - physics, biochemistry 

Limitations of Scientific Inquiry
1. Science can only study where scientific method can be applied
2. Science can only study physical, recurrent, natural phenomena 
    * Cannot study unique events
    * Need to study over and over again 
    * No miracles
3. Science can only offer materialistic & mechanical explanations
    * Can only explain w physics, chemistry
    * Cannot study God, soul, ideas, free will, intangibles, nonphysical4. 
4. Science is amoral


Sir John Eccles - neurobiologist 
Erich Fromm - student of Freud, ideas similar to Jung, the human situation


What is life?

Part 3

Characteristics of Living Things
1. Made up of cells
2. Require energy to remain alive
    * Metabolism
    * Breakdown of food with oxygen to release energy/co2
3. Growth & Development
    * Anabolic process
    * Sexual maturation, metamorphosis, tadpoles to frog
4. Respond to changes in environment
5. Reproduce -except mules, women over 60
6. Adapt to change in environment
    * Homeostasis (constant internal state)
    * Evolution-a population adapting to changes in evolution

Unique Characteristics of Human Beings
1. Language
2. Culture
3. Self-awareness, self-critical, living simultaneously in past, present, and future. - Other animals do not do this!
4. Anticipate and plan for future, we recognize our own mortality. - Dogs don’t panic and say to themselves oh I need to accomplish this I am going to die soon!

Levels of Organization
1. Subatomic Particles: electrons, protons [physics]
2. Atoms [physics] 
3. Molecules: atoms form molecules when combined. H2O. [chemistry] 
4. Organelles [cytology]
5. Cells: mitochondria, lysosomes, etc [cytology] 
6. Tissues: muscle tissue cells, nerve tissue cells, etc.  [histology] 
7. Organs: digestive system, circulatory system, etc. [anatomy/physiology]
8. Organ Systems [anatomy/physiology]
9. Multicellular Organisms [anatomy/physiology] 
10. Populations [zoology/botany/microbiology]
11. Biotic Communities: ie tide pools   [zoology/botany/microbiology]
12. Ecosystems (Biomes): similar climate, plants, and animals. Ie desert ecosystem [zoology/botany/microbiology]
13. Biosphere: Earth [zoology/botany/microbiology]

Eco = home

Applications of Biology
A. AGRICULTURE AND FOOD PRODUCTION 
B. MEDICINE AND NUTRITION, HEALTH AND DRUGS
C. ENVIRONMENTAL RELATIONS 

*if we don’t have food to eat, nothing else matters. Over 6B people, at least 1B-3B starving or malnourished.
*why do we have so much food? We know how to produce lots of food at low cost. We are mechanized.

Part 4-5

EVOLUTION

Examples: 
1. Insect resistance to pesticides
2. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics
3. Artificial selection in animal breeding and plant cultivation

Can living things change and change to the point where they look significantly significantly different?
Where in fact they are now a totally different thing.

Critiques:
1. Why haven’t cockroaches changed? Adapted well?
2. Age of the earth and fossils
3. Artificial selection of plants and animals reveals apparent limits to change
4. Changes in hereditary traits is almost always harmful
5. How could inanimate matter evolve properties beyond inanimate matter (self-maintenance, life, consciousness, self-consciousness.

Genetic information can be altered in testes and eggs
By X-rays

INTRODUCTION TO CHEMISTRY

WHAT ARE ELEMENTS?
- The smallest sample of an element is called an ATOM
- What is an atom?
    - Structure: center = nucleus; in the nucleus there are positive charged particles protons and neutral neutrons and negative electrons
    - There are some atoms w no neutrons
    - ***Neutrons provide stability, # of neutrons determines physical stability
    - Unstable = radioactive
    - Neutrons>protons tend to be radioactive
    - Atomic weight = protons + neutrons (electrons are too light) 
			More on Electrons:
                - They circle around the nucleus of the atom
                - ***The # of electrons in the atoms OUTER orbit determines the chemical properties/behavior of an atom
                - Inner most orbit can hold up to 2 electrons, then 8
                - Outer orbits can hold up to max of 8 electrons THE OCTET RULE, THE RULE OF 8s
    - An atom starts out with the same number of electrons (-) as protons (+)
    - ***Atomic no.—the # of protons—determines type of element

￼

Hydrogen Atom: 1 proton and 1 electron zero neutrons
- The simplest ever atom
- Atomic # of 1
- Atomic wt (weight) = 1

Carbon Atoms: 6+ protons, 6- electrons, 6 neutrons
- Atomic # of 6
- Atomic wt = 12

Carbon Atom: 6+ protons, 6- electrons, 8 neutrons
- Atomic # of 6
- Atomic wt = 14

Nitrogen Atom: 7+ protons, 7- electrons, 7 neutrons
- Atomic # of 7
- Atomic wt = 14

Phosphorous Atom: 15+ protons, 15- electrons, 15 neutrons
- Atomic # of 15
- Atomic wt = 30

CHNOPS
- The most important elements of living things. Listed in order of most important!!!
1. C = CARBON - most living things are carbon based
2. H = HYDROGEN
3. N = NITROGEN
4. O = OXYGEN
5. P = PHOSPHOROUS
6. S = SULFUR
7. NA =  sodium
8. CI = chlorine
9. K = potassium
10. I = iodine
11. Fe = iron
12. Ca = calcium
13. U = uranium


ATOMIC WEIGHT MINUS PROTONS = # OF NEUTRONS
More neutrons than protons more instability!!

PERIODIC TABLE
- Russian chemist Mendeleev grouped similarchemical properties
- Group 1: alkaline metals have 1 electron/hydrogen family
- Group 2: alkaline metals have 1 electron
- Halogen Family
- Noble gases

METALS: give away electrons, metals conduct electricity because they release electrons, the more left, the more metallic (the more they give away electrons)
i.e. NA (SODIUM)

NONMETALS: grab electrons, do not conduct electricity, the takers, the biggest takers are column 7 the halogens
I.E. CL (CHLORINE)

   CL + NA ‎ =  SALT

NOBLE GASES: neither give or take. Don’t need anyone, they got what they want. The other elements tend to react.

***elements on the boundary line of metal/non metal are metalloids, they sometimes give and sometimes take. They are reluctant givers and takers. Who cares? Well silicone sometimes gives and sometimes take.

i.e. All computers are made of silicone wavers and are made of binary code 1s and zeroes. Computers STORE 1s and 0s, silicones can give or take. If silicones takes its a 1, if silicone gives 0s. Computers cannot be made from just givers and just takers. Hence the name semi-conductors. Sometimes conducts electricity.

Uranium is the heaviest naturally occurring element. Atomic no. 92. Avg weight 238. 146 neutrons. Radioactive!!!
